Code developed for my undergraduate thesis: "How could fish win a race through Reinforcement Learning". 
In this project, Reinforcement Learning is used to help a CFD software maximize the acceleration and efficiency of a larval zebrafish during multiple simulations.
This code could just be ran in the UCCS mechanical engineering computer, where the CFD software is. Any attempt in a different computer will just return random results.
